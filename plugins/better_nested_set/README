= Better nested set

This plugin provides an ehanced acts_as_nested_set mixin for ActiveRecord, the object-db mapping layer of the framework RubyOnRails. The original nested set feature seems to be quite old and missed some necessary functionalities.

== Details

This acts provides Nested Set functionality. Nested Set is a smart way to implement
an _ordered_ tree, with the added feature that you can select the children and all of their 
descendents with a single query. The drawback is that insertion or move need some complex
sql queries. But everything is done behind the curtains by this module!

Nested sets are appropriate each time you want either an orderd tree (menus, 
commercial categories) or an efficient way of querying big trees (threaded posts).

See http://www.dbmsmag.com/9603d06.html for nested sets theory, and a tutorial here:
http://threebit.net/tutorials/nestedset/tutorial1.html

== Small nested set theory reminder

Instead of picturing a leaf node structure with children pointing back to their parent,
the best way to imagine how this works is to think of the parent entity surrounding all
of its children, and its parent surrounding it, etc.  Assuming that they are lined up
horizontally, we store the left and right boundries in the database.

Imagine:
  root
    |_ Child 1
      |_ Child 1.1
      |_ Child 1.2
    |_ Child 2
      |_ Child 2.1
      |_ Child 2.2

If my cirlces in circles description didn't make sense, check out this sweet
ASCII art:

    ___________________________________________________________________
   |  Root                                                             |
   |    ____________________________    ____________________________   |
   |   |  Child 1                  |   |  Child 2                  |   |
   |   |   __________   _________  |   |   __________   _________  |   |
   |   |  |  C 1.1  |  |  C 1.2 |  |   |  |  C 2.1  |  |  C 2.2 |  |   |
   1   2  3_________4  5________6  7   8  9_________10 11_______12 13  14
   |   |___________________________|   |___________________________|   |
   |___________________________________________________________________| 

The numbers represent the left and right boundries.  The table then might
look like this:
   id | parent_is | left | right | data
    1 |           |    1 |    14 | root
    2 |         1 |    2 |     7 | Child 1
    3 |         2 |    3 |     4 | Child 1.1
    4 |         2 |    5 |     6 | Child 1.2
    5 |         1 |    8 |    13 | Child 2
    6 |         5 |    9 |    10 | Child 2.1
    7 |         5 |   11 |    12 | Child 2.2

So, to get all children of an entry 'parent', you
    SELECT * WHERE left IS BETWEEN parent.left AND parent.right

To get the count, it's (right - left - 1)/2, etc.
To get the direct parent, it falls back to using the parent_id field.   
There are instance methods for all of these.


= API

Methods names are aligned on Tree's ones as much as possible, to make replacment from one 
by another easier, except for the creation:

in acts_as_tree:

  item.children.create(:name => "child1")

in acts_as_nested_set:

  # adds a new item at the "end" of the tree, i.e. with child.left = max(tree.right)+1
  child = MyClass.new(:name => "child1")
  child.save
  # now move the item to its right place
  child.move_to_child_of my_item

You can use:
* <tt>move_to_child_of</tt>
* <tt>move_to_right_of</tt>
* <tt>move_to_left_of</tt>
and pass them an id or an object.

Other methods added by this mixin are:
* <tt>root</tt> - root item of the tree (the one that has a nil parent; should have left_column = 1 too)
* <tt>roots</tt> - root items, in case of multiple roots (the ones that have a nil parent)
* <tt>level</tt> - number indicating the level, a root being level 0
* <tt>ancestors</tt> - array of all parents, with root as first item
* <tt>self_and_ancestors</tt> - array of all parents and self
* <tt>siblings</tt> - array of all siblings, that are the items sharing the same parent and level
* <tt>self_and_siblings</tt> - array of itself and all siblings
* <tt>children_count</tt> - count of all immediate children
* <tt>children</tt> - array of all immediate childrens
* <tt>all_children</tt> - array of all children and nested children
* <tt>full_set</tt> - array of itself and all children and nested children

These should not be useful, except if you want to write direct SQL:
* <tt>left_col_name</tt> - name of the left column passed on the declaration line
* <tt>right_col_name</tt> - name of the right column passed on the declaration line    
* <tt>parent_col_name</tt> - name of the parent column passed on the declaration line

== Recommandation

Don't name your left and right columns 'left' and 'right': these names are reserved on most of dbs.
Usage is to name them 'lft' and 'rgt' for instance.
