Dependencies for Building
=========================

- You need rake to build the extensions and install them.

  You can get it from rubyforge:
    http://rubyforge.org/projects/rake

  or just type

  # gem install rake

  for the installation via rubygems.

- If you want to rebuild the parser.c file or draw nice graphviz images of the
  state machines, you need ragel from:
    http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel

Installation
============

It's recommended to use the extension variant of JSON, because it's quite a bit
faster than the pure ruby variant. If you cannot build it on your system, you
can settle for the latter.

Just type into the command line as root:

# rake install

The above command will build the extensions and install them on your system.

# rake install_pure

or

# ruby install.rb

will just install the pure ruby implementation of JSON.

If you use Rubygems you can type

# gem install json

instead, to install the newest JSON version.

There is also a pure ruby json only variant of the gem, that can be installed
with:

# gem install json_pure

Testing and Examples
====================

To run the tests type:

$ rake test_ext

This will build the extensions first and then test them.

$ rake test_pure

This will test the pure ruby extensions.

There is also a small example in tools/server.rb if you want to see, how
receiving a JSON object from a webrick server in your browser with the
javasript prototype library (http://www.prototypejs.org) works.
