# Overriding Views

You can override views by putting custom `rhtml` or `liquid`
templates in this directory. You use the same folder structure
as Rails:

  templates/
    [controller_name]/
      _overriden_partial.rhtml
      overriden_action.rhtml

*Note:* These are overrides! They will only work if they have
a matching view in the main rails `app/views` folder.


# Images, JS and Stylesheets

You don't have to move images, javascript-files or stylesheets into the
public directory, but can use them right away from the themes directory.

For using images in your stylesheets you must use paths like this:
  background-image: url(/images/theme_name/background.png)

To include a stylesheet in your layout:
  <%= theme_stylesheet_link_tag 'styles' %>


# Directory structure

  theme_name/
    about.yml
    images/
    javascripts/         # your javascripts. theme_javascript_include_tag
    README               # this file
    stylesheets/         # your stylesheets. theme_stylesheet_link_tag
    templates/           # all your templates
      blog/
        index.html.erb   # will overwrite index view of your blog sections
      layouts/
        default.html.erb # overwrites the default layout
      shared/
        footer.html.erb  # a shared file included from your layout


# Installation steps

Generating a new theme is only half the work, to use your theme you need to
copy it into your site's subdirectory or create a sym-link:
  cd themes/site-1"
  ln -s ../theme_name .  ## symlink OR
  cp -R ../theme_name .
