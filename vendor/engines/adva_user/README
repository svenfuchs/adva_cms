As suggested by the author of this plugin, Bart Duchesne, we've used the 
loginui plugin as a scaffolding and modified it for our own needs.

See http://rubyforge.org/projects/loginui/ for more information about this 
fantastic plugin.

= Login Plugin

Provides a basic user interface for allowing a user to accomplish the
following tasks:

* Login (with Remember Me)
* Logout

* Forgot Password
* Change Password

* Register (with email verification)
* Delete User
* Restore Deleted User

== Dependencies

This plugin is implemented with the help of the "Engine" plugin and
can either be considered reusable slice of an application or can
be considered scaffolding to your own login work you will add later
to your project.

This plugin also does not implement the actual authentication process
itself or even define the "User" object that is authenticated against.
It just assumes certain functionality is available and any application
that implements that functionality can use this plugin to provide the
UI for their authentication.

If you do not have your own backend authentication I highly suggest you
check out the authentication plugin by the same author of this plugin.
Although not required to go together they do together provide a
complete authentication system.

== Development Status

This code has been used on many sites so it is fairly reliable. But all
the sites it has been used on are very similar in design so some
aspects that our outside of this design may not be tested as well. For
example all the sites it is currently used on has email for the username.
So if you don't use email for username (or don't even have an email
field) it *should* work but has not received significant testing.

Another aspect is Rails 1.x vs. Rails 2.0 apps. This was developed under
Rails 1.x and 95% of sites using this plugin are on Rails 1.x. But it
has been taken to Rails 2.0 and seems to work well there.

I welcome patches towards making this plugin work in different
environments.

== Your User model

Regardless of if you use the authentication plugin or build your own
you will need a user model that this plugin assumes. The user model
must be named "User". Also your User model needs a field that can
serve as the username. "email" is prefered (because people can
remember that) but username and user_name will also be accepted. If
you have something completely different then implement a class method
on the user object called "username_field" this method should return
whatever field is being used as your username.

== Optional support

The email notifications will only be sent if a "email" field is
on the model. This is regardless of what you use for a username. There
is currently no way to disable email notifications if you have the
email field. Obviously the "forgot my password" feature will not work
without an email field on the User model as well.

== Providing your own authentication

If you want to provide your own authentication system instead of using
the authentication plugin you will need to implement the following
actions on your User model.

=== Required methods

password=:: Will assign the model a new password
assign_token(name, expiration=nil)::
  Will return a token that can be used to authenticate the user with.
  This is used for URL token authentication (in email confirmation,
  forgot password and restore deleted user) and also used in the
  "Remember Me" authentication. The expiration can be considered
  optional.
authenticate(password)::
  Will authenticate the current user against the given password
  returning true or false to indicate the success

=== Optional methods

password_confirmation=::
  Not required but if the model responds to this method then it
  will receive a copy of the password when a user is updating
  their password for verification purposes.
deleted_at and deleted_at=::
  If the model responds to deleted_at and deleted_at then when
  a user is removed it will just get a date/time value to indicate
  the user has been removed. It will assume once a object has this
  value it will not be found unless User.find_with_deleted is used.
  This is compatible with acts_as_paraniod
User.find_with_deleted(*find_args)::
  If the User class responds to then then this will be called when
  attempting to restore a user. This is for compatibility with
  acts_as_paranoid and anything else implementing that interface.
