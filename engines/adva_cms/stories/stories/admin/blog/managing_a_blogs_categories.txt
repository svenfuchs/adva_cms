Story: Managing a blog's categories
  As an admin
  I want to manage my blog's categories
  So I can categorize content
  
  Scenario: An admin creates a new blog category
    Given a blog with no categories
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin blog categories list page
    Then the page has an empty list
    When the user clicks on 'Create one now'
    Then the page has an admin category creation form
    When the user fills in the admin category creation form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Save' button
    Then a new category has been saved 
    And the user is redirected the admin blog categories list page
    And the page has a list of categories with the new category listed

  Scenario: An admin updates a category
    Given a blog with a category
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin blog category edit page
    Then the page has an admin category edit form
    When the user fills in title with 'an updated title'
    And the user clicks the 'Save' button
    Then the category's title is set to 'an updated title'
    And the user is redirected the admin blog category edit page
