1. negotiating required vs. granted roles

	required_roles = context.required_roles_for(action)
	has_role?(required_roles, context)

2. expand roles/contexts so we can create css classes from it

	roles = context.required_role_for('edit article').expand
	quoted_role_names(roles)
	# => "article-1-author blog-1-moderator site-1-moderator site-1-admin"
	
	"article-1-author blog-1-author site-1-author 
	 article-1-moderator blog-1-moderator site-1-moderator 
	 article-1-admin blog-1-admin site-1-admin"
	
	=> brauchen wir konzept "minimum context type" für roles?

3. displaying roles per virtual actions per context type

	Blog permissions settings form:
	[moderator] is allowed to [create] an article     [+]
	[author]    is allowed to [edit]   an article     [+][-]

	=> kein problem


Manage roles

	Role name: ...
	Role context: (o) Site (o) Section <= ???




RBAC

# things to improve

- we must be able to define "everything" (roles, contexts, hierarchies) more
  flexibly. i.e.: provide sensible defaults in adva-cms, overwrite/extend them
  at startup time (initializer) in adva-best or facility-best

- we must be able to define additional/custom roles at runtime dynamically, 
  these must behave the same way as predefined roles do

- roles should not be tied to particular contexts as they are now

- the system should be able to grant users roles/permissions based on their
  membership in a group

# notes

- acl9's wording of roles being "scoped" to contexts makes sense. they should
  not be scoped/tied to particular types of contexts though. why not just let
  the user choose? because potentially not all roles make sense in all contexts?

# concepts we need

- contexts require roles for actions to be allowed. e.g. a Blog requires users
  to be at least a :moderator in the scope of the Site when they want to create
  an Article

- roles can include other roles. e.g. the :superuser role includes all other 
  roles. the site :admin role includes all other roles in the context of the
  site

# use cases

- saas adva-cms: manager has an account and 2 sites. he adds a role :editor
  to his sites, makes two members of his account editor in the context of each 
  site and defines article create/edit permissions for editors. the editors should
  then be able to create/edit articles on the sites they are editors on.

- facility-best: manager owns an account and has tons of renters. the application
  defines that each renter has view access to his own contracts
  
- facility-best: manager owns an account and has an accountant. the admin defines
  a role :accountant and defines that only accountants may view + manage accounts

- facility-best: manager owns an account and adds an owner to a facility or unit.
  the owner can not update attributes on the facility or unit and related objects.

- facility-best: renter can only view the units (and associated objects) he has 
  rented.

- facility-best: renter can view tickets that belong to his unit or his unit's 
  facility. owner can view all tickets for his facilities. manager can view all
  tickets for all facilities belonging to his account.
