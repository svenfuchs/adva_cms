Our infinitely awesome Lighthouse is at: http://artweb-design.lighthouseapp.com/projects/13992-adva_cms/overview

Please use it :)

## Prerequisites

Rails 2.1

## Installation

* cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
* run rake db:migrate:all to setup the database (Sqlite for toying)
* start the server
* visit http://localhost:3000

Optionally tweak config/database.yml (e.g. for MySQL) and run rake db:create, 
then continue as above.

You should be directed to an installation screen. Fill out the form and you're
started.

The forum section type currently does not work, so don't add a forum to your
site.

## Running specs and stories

To run the specs use:

    script/spec -O spec/spec.opts <path>
  
with `<path>` being a directory containing specs, a single spec filename
or a path glob specification like `spec/controllers/blog*`

E.g.

    script/spec -O spec/spec.opts spec # will run all specs
    script/spec -O spec/spec.opts spec/controllers/blog_controller_spec.rb # will run the blog_controller spec
    ruby stories/run.rb stories/stories/*routes* # will run all routes specs


Same thing with the stories, except that you run the stories/run.rb script.
To run the stories use:

    ruby stories/run.rb <path>

with `<path>` being a directory containing stories, a single story filename
or a path glob specification like `stories/stories/blog*`

E.g.

    ruby stories/run.rb stories # will run all stories
    ruby stories/run.rb stories/stories/login.txt # will run the login story
    ruby stories/run.rb stories/stories/blog* # will run all blog stories
