  As an admin
  I want to manage my site's plugins
  So I can see what's installed and change config options
  
  Scenario: An admin reviews the plugin list
    Given a site
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin plugin list page
    Then the list contains all the plugins installed
