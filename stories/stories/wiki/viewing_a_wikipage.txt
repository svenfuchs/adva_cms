Story: Viewing a wikipage
  As a visitor 
  I want to access a wiki's pages
  So I can read all the useful information

  Scenario: Viewing an empty wiki
    Given page cache is enabled and empty
    And a wiki that allows anonymous users to create and update wikipages
    And no wikipage
    When the user visits the wiki home page
    Then the page has a wikipage creation form
    And the page is not cached
  
  Scenario: Viewing the wiki home wikipage
    Given page cache is enabled and empty
    And a home wikipage
    When the user visits the wiki home page
    Then the page shows 'the home wikipage body'
    And the edit link is only visible for certain roles
    And the page is cached
  
  Scenario: Viewing a wikipage
